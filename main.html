            <p>Thanks to Sweet Love, I have found the love of my life and we are to be married.
                After going on a few dates and having a few fun nights, I came across Gurleen. After reading her profile, I couldn't resist swiping right after reading her final sentence... "Looking for my super babe for life".  After talking for about a week, we went out on our first date, and I knew there was something special about her!

            <p>Other dating apps were like shooting fish in a barrel. But my girlfriend and I clicked right away on Sweet Love, and the conversation was effortless. We've been together for over a year. <br> Thank you Sweet Love! We're getting married in a few months!
            Sweet Love's prompts really made the difference.
